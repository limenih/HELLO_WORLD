AN AUTONOMOUS AUTOMATIC PHOTOVOLTAIC (SOLAR) DRIP SYSTEM
OBJECTIVE:
　　　　The aim of the project is to automatically maintain the agriculture land by using embedded system technology with help of solar system.
　　　　Drip irrigation, also known as trickle irrigation or micro irrigation is an irrigation method which minimizes the use of water and fertilizer by allowing water to drip slowly to the roots of plants, either onto the soil surface or directly onto the root zone, through a network of valves, pipes, tubing, and emitters.
	The automatic Drip irrigation system is used to maintain the agricultural land water supply system in time base activation by using embedded system technology. This whole system power supply is supplied by solar system. This project has two parts, one part is timer circuit and another one is water pump flow control system. 
	The controller is programmed to set the pump on/off timings in the Micro-controller. The controller directly controls the water pumping system. The controller continuously watches the timer module. When ever the timer reach the set time, automatically switch on the pumping circuit. Now the water will supply to the land.         
　　　　This project is implemented using PIC micro-controller, Alarm, Driver unit and LCD display with key pad.
